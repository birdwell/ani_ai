Below is an example of how you can set up your repository with a README.md, a .gitignore file, and a requirements.txt file. This setup assumes your project includes at least the following files:
• baseline_recommender.py – Contains your recommendation logic.
• api.py – Your FastAPI application.
• (Other files like your SQLite database files and checkpoint file.)

You can customize the following examples as needed.

README.md

# Ani_AI

Ani_AI is a personal recommendation engine for anime based on your AniList data. It ingests your personal lists (e.g., COMPLETED, PLANNING) and global AniList data to produce recommendations. The project includes:

- A baseline recommender (`baseline_recommender.py`) that scores shows based on your watched (or rated) anime and boosts planned shows.
- A FastAPI server (`api.py`) that exposes the recommendations via an HTTP API.
- A global data ingestion script (not shown here) that caches all AniList shows into a local SQLite database.

## Features

- **User Preference Extraction:** Uses your completed anime data to build a weighted profile of your genre/tag preferences.
- **Content-based Recommendation:** Scores global anime based on similarity to your preferences.
- **Planned List Boost:** Boosts the score of shows in your `PLANNING` list.
- **Genre Filtering:** Optionally filter recommendations by a desired genre.
- **API Interface:** Access your recommendations through a REST API built with FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ani_ai.git
cd ani_ai
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Running the Application

Running the Baseline Recommender (CLI)

You can run the recommender directly from the command line:

`python baseline_recommender.py`

Follow the prompt to optionally enter a genre filter.

5. Running the API Server

The API is built with FastAPI. To run it with auto-reload during development:

`uvicorn api:app --reload`

Then, navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser to view the interactive API documentation.

Files and Directories
• baseline_recommender.py – Script that computes recommendations.
• api.py – FastAPI server exposing recommendation endpoints.
• requirements.txt – Lists all Python dependencies.
• .gitignore – Specifies files and directories to ignore (e.g., virtual environments, SQLite databases).

6. Updating Global Data

The project includes a separate ingestion script (not shown here) to import global AniList data into anilist_global.db. This cache helps avoid rate limiting when generating recommendations.
